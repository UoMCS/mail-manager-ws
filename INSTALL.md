Mail Manager Web Service
========================

Dependencies
------------

This software requires [PEAR::Mail](http://pear.php.net/package/Mail) to be installed and available in the `include_path`.

Installation
------------

As this is a relatively simple PHP script, installation should be as simple as cloning the repository and setting the virtual host document root to `htdocs`.

You also need to copy `config.inc.php.example` to `config.inc.php` and fill in the relevant configuration variables.
